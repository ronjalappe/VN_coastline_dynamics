Workflow - Draft: 

1) SHORELINE CHANGE 
Inputs:
1. Clip OSM shoreline to AOI 
2. Create 20 km buffer around it (to guarantee an equal proportion of land and water for the Otsu threshold to work) 
3. Subdivide Polygon to areas < 20.000km2 
4. Time period for each Sensor 

Processing GEE: 
1. Image retrieval (one ImageCollection per year)
For LANDSAT 5 & LANDSAT 8
2. Cloud masking of all selected images
(3. Removal of all empty ImageCollections)
4. Create band with number of (cloud-free) observation per pixel for each ImageCollection 
5. Calcualtion of MNDWI (no-water: ≈< 0, water ≈>0) 
6. Creation of Percentile 80 image from MNDWI ImageCollection (to reflect high tide situation) 
7. Merge LS5 and LS8 ImageCollection to one Image Collection
8. Calculate Otsu threshold for each image 
9. Create Binary Land Water Image using the threshold 
10. Export binary images to Google Drive 

Postprocessing locally: 
1. Automatic download from Google Drive 
2. Reproject images to projected coordinate system 
3. Mask out pixel with only 1 observation 

ON THE ONE HAND:
   4. Marching Square Contouring 
   5. Contour Smoothing using Gaussian Filter, Sigma:3
   6. Removal of lines < 3 km to eliminate small inland water bodies or islands/ ships etc. 
ON THE OTHER: 
   3. Calculate min water extent raster 
   4. Remove pixel cluster < 50 km2
   5. Vectorize raster
   6. Merge min water extent polygons of all processing tiles 
   7. Smooth polygon line  
   8. Input: GADM admin boundary polygon (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/viet-nam-administrative-boundaries-polygon-polyline)
   9. Smooth land polygon 
   10. Create shore perpendicular transects along land polygon
   11. Clip transects to min water extent raster 
BRING TOGETHER: 
   12. Calcualte intersections between annual shorelines and transects

Analysis:
 1. Quantify coastline change along transects 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.) TIDAL EFFECTS QUANTIFICATION 
Identification of low and high tide Landsat acquisitions:
1. Cleaning of sea level data
2. Calcualtion of Landat overpass time 
3. Filtering of sea level data by Landsat acquisition hour 
4. Identification of low and high tide peaks (DOY +/- 1)
5. creation of low and high tide date lists for each available year 

Selection of nearly cloud-free LS images at low and high tides 
1. Filter Landsat archive by 3-day date range 
2. calculate cloud cover within AOI 
3. Filter by CC (< 20%)
4. Cloud masking 
5. Create daily mosaics 
6. Remove mosaics covering <= 2/3 of AOI 
7. Create low and high tide image pairs 
8. Extract smooth shorelines (compare 1. method)
9. Calculate displacement between low and high tide shorelines for each image pair (Median, std, range)
