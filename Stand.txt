- OSM shoreline could be simplified
- Transects of have created for it (generally better solution)
BUT:
- clipping of rfsl shoreline to box has not been working yet (to much processing for tests)
- transect line still to edgy, maybe reduce tolerance of simplification
NEXT:
- figure transect orientation!
