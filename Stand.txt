Stand letzte Woche

ISSUE: one intersection per year and transect is definetly pos sible, but I couldn't find an appropriate method yet
- tested: 
    + closest to osm reference shoreline (is confused when rfsl is complex, or high dynamic)
    + outermost points (seawards, works mostly fine, but problematic with islands)
    + closest to median points (just also confused, when transect cut several structures)
- other ideas? 
    + keep them all and....
    + maybe choose the outermost and exclude islands from entire analysis 
    + but somehow difficult this one... 
- solution: 
    + cut transects at vectorized, harmonized min water extent raster

ISSUE: if year doesn't exist at shore (due to cloud cover), intersection point with inland water is chosen 
- tested:
    + remove outlier (2*std): excludes good points too where std is very small
    + cut transects to max water extent raster as well (too patchy cause it includes all inland waters that have ever 
    been detected, results in many transect multilinestrings)
- other ideas? 
    + use fixed distance, if point is more than 1 km from median, exclude it? 
    + mhmm... still stuck with the same fuckin problem, I'm afraid :( 

THOUGH, IMPROVED SOMETHING! :) 



09.03. my activities of last week: 
- transects: chose the outmost intersection point for each year, if it is fu
- rework javascript code for raster processing 
- made it more efficient with less server-client interaction  
- included a pixel-based quality layer with cloud-free observations per pixel (highly depends on the satellite path, much 
  better in Central Vietnam than e.g. in the MD)
- worked with quality layer in rasterio (calculate average observations per pixel )
